        <p>
            Shaul Y. Khayyat is a student at the prestigous Lander College for Men, where he is 
            currently studying Talmud and Computer Science. Nearly ten years ago, Shaul 
            discovered a passion and talent for photography. In the years since, he has travelled
            to some of the most scenic locations in New York, New Jersey, Toronto, and Jerusalem. 
            As a yeshiva bochur, Shaul has a unique perspective and view which comes through in his photos.
